# FAQ

## My Game Requires Multiple Ports Allocated

Our module supports games or applications that require multiple ports. We've implemented a comprehensive solution to facilitate the allocation of multiple ports as needed. For detailed guidance on setting this up, please refer to the following sections of our documentation:

- **Ports Ranges**: Understand how to define and allocate ranges of ports for your game or application. [Ports Ranges Documentation](https://github.com/wohahobg/PteroSync/wiki/Ports-Ranges)

- **Server Port Offset**: Learn about setting up port offsets, which is crucial for games or applications that require a query port based on the server's main port number. [Server Port Offset Documentation](https://github.com/wohahobg/PteroSync/wiki/Server-Port-Offset)

- **Examples**: See practical examples of how to configure and use these features. [Examples Documentation](https://github.com/wohahobg/PteroSync/wiki/Examples)


## Overwriting Values Through Configurable Options
Values can be overwritten using either Configurable Options or Custom Fields.

The name should exactly match what you want to overwrite. For example, `dedicated_ip` will overwrite the `dedicated_ip` value based on its selection. Valid options include `server_name`, `memory`, `swap`, `io`, `cpu`, `disk`, `nest_id`, `egg_id`, `pack_id`, `location_id`, `dedicated_ip`, `ports_ranges`, `image`, `startup`, `databases`, `allocations`, `backups`, `oom_disabled`, `username`.

This approach also applies to any environment variable name. For instance, `Player Slots` will overwrite the environment variable named "Player Slots" to its value.

Useful trick: You can use the | seperator to change the display name of the variable like this: dedicated_ip|Dedicated IP => Will be displayed as "Dedicated IP" but will work correctly.

## Couldn't find any nodes satisfying the request
This can be caused from any of the following: Wrong location, not enough disk space/CPU/RAM, or no allocations matching the provided criteria.
